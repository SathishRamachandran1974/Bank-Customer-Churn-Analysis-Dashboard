## üè¶Bank Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard
  -  This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built on bank customer data to uncover churn patterns, customer demographics, and behavioral insights.
     With KPIs, filters, and storytelling visuals, it highlights the factors influencing churn such as age, credit score, balance, products, and tenure, helping
     the bank design effective retention strategies.
 
## Objective
  -  This project delivers a Power BI dashboard to analyze bank customer churn by demographics, financial behavior, and engagement patterns. It provides actionable
     insights to identify at-risk customers, improve retention, and boost long-term loyalty. Key KPIs such as total customers, churn rate, average credit score, and
     average balance provide a quick overview, while filters allow deeper exploration of churn drivers across age, gender, geography, and products.

## Key Project Goals

  - Understand the impact of credit score, balance, and income on churn.
  - Evaluate customer engagement through tenure, product holding, and activity status.
  - Provide clear KPIs for tracking churn and customer loyalty.
  - Build an interactive reporting tool with slicers/filters for in-depth exploration.

## Tools & Techniques
  - Power BI ‚Üí Dashboard design and visualization 
  - Power Query ‚Üí Data cleaning and transformation
  - DAX Measures ‚Üí KPI calculations (Churn Rate, Avg Balance, Avg Tenure)
  - Storytelling ‚Üí Visual narrative of customer churn drivers and patterns

## Storytelling ‚Äì The Insights Behind the Dashboard
  - The Bank Churn dashboard converts raw customer data into meaningful business insights. Customers aged 35‚Äì50 are most vulnerable to churn, especially those with high balances
    and medium credit scores. Gender does not significantly influence churn, but geography does, with France and Germany showing higher churn rates than Spain. Financial behavior
    reveals that single-product customers churn more, while multi-product customers are more loyal. Tenure and engagement are strong retention factors, as long-term and active
    customers are less likely to exit. Credit card ownership also improves retention. These insights help identify at-risk segments and guide targeted strategies for customer retention.

## Insights
  - Mid-aged customers (35‚Äì50 years) with high balances are at the highest risk of churn.
  - Medium credit score (600‚Äì699) customers churn more than high or low credit score groups.
  - Single-product customers show the highest exit rates, while multi-product customers stay longer.
  - Low-tenure customers churn more, proving loyalty builds over time.
  - Geography plays a role, with France and Germany showing higher churn than Spain.
  - Active members and credit card holders are less likely to churn, showing engagement reduces risk.

## Conclusion
  - This project demonstrates how Power BI can transform customer churn data into actionable insights. By analyzing demographics, financial behavior, tenure, and engagement,
    the dashboard provides a clear picture of churn drivers and risk segments. With KPIs and filters, it supports both high-level tracking and in-depth exploration.
    The storytelling approach connects churn analytics to business strategy, helping banks improve customer retention, enhance loyalty programs, and protect long-term profitability.
